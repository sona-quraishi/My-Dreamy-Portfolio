## 🎨 Theme / Inspiration

The theme of this portfolio is bright, cheerful, and feminine. I used a pink and light blue color scheme to give a soft and friendly feel. The fonts and colors reflect my personal taste and creative style. This website represents who I am and what I enjoy.

## 🎯 Design Decisions

- Used Flexbox and Grid layouts for responsive structure.
- Implemented a dark mode option.
- Applied Google Fonts to enhance typography.
- Added hover effects and smooth transitions to improve user interaction.
- Designed custom sections: Home, About Me, Projects, Gallery, and Contact.
- Included custom images and graphics related to my interests.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 (Semantic elements)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Transitions)
- Google Fonts

## 🧩 Challenges

- Creating a full dark mode using only CSS without JavaScript.
- Making the website fully responsive on different screen sizes.
- Organizing assets (images, books, etc.) properly for GitHub deployment.
