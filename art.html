                <h2>Arts form my heart</h2>
<P>A world of art flows inside me; a world that comes to life with thread and needle, becomes meaningful with color and line, refreshes the soul of the house with the aroma of food, and shouts the voice of my heart with the words of my heart notes.
    For me, sewing is not just sewing clothes, it is a connection between hands and heart; each stitch is a balm for my soul.
    Drawing is the language of my silences; each line I draw is a story that was not told but felt.
    For me, cooking is not just cooking food, it is a loving worship; a moment when taste, smell, and love combine to give warmth.
    And my heart notes are the sound of my nightly whispers, when no one is there, but the words are with me.
    
    These arts are pieces of my being; not to be seen, but to survive.
    I live with art, I cry with it, I laugh with it, and I find myself again.
    These are not just skills, these are my very being, flowing in the moment of my being.</P></div>

                <P>The Art of Drawing | “The Silence That Draws”
                    White paper is a place for my most silent cries.
                    I draw, not because I know how, but because my heart wants to be seen.
                    Every line is an emotion; every color is a memory.
                    Drawing for me means saying the words that my mouth cannot express.</P>

                <P>The Art of Sewing | “Stitches of the Soul”
                    Amidst threads and fabrics, there is a peace that no one but me understands.
                    Each stitch is a word that has passed through my heart and sat on the garment.
                    I sew my pains with a needle and create beauty.
                    Sewing is an art that speaks with my hands.</P></div>

                            My heartfelt is the voice of a heart that no one hears except paper.
                            I don’t write to be seen,
                            I write so that I don’t forget who I was, what I felt.
                            My words are a refuge for my tired soul…
                            And every word is a piece of me</P></div>

                Cooking for me is not just about cooking; it is about creating warmth that fills the heart.
                In every bite, I put a stamp and in every aroma, a memory.
                I love with flavors;
                For myself, for my home, for the hearts I love.</P></div>
