        <h1>My Style</h1>
        <P>My style is not just a collection of clothes or colors; it is a mirror of my inner self, a voice that has a lot to say without saying words. Every time I wear a dress, I actually show a piece of myself to the world; that girl who is both gentle and powerful; a dreamer and determined.
    
            My style comes from my heart; from the days I spend alone with myself, from the memories that are nestled in my heart, from the dreams that are still waiting for me to reach them. When I choose a dress, it is as if I am talking to myself: How do you feel today? What do you want? Sometimes I choose soft colors, because I want peace; sometimes special and different clothes, because I want to tell the world: “I am unique.”
            
            The designs and patterns of my clothes reflect my life story. Sometimes a simple scarf is a refuge for me; sometimes a colorful shirt reminds me of the little girl who still lives inside me. I don’t dress just to look pretty; I dress to embrace myself, just as I am. My style is a kind of self-discovery; a silent language to say: “I love myself, even if I’m not perfect yet.”
            
            I believe that true beauty comes from within, but my style is a bridge that shows this inner beauty to the world. Every time I stand in front of the mirror, I don’t wear clothes that others like; I wear clothes that make me happy, that give me confidence, that remind me how special and valuable my path is.
            
            With my style, I love myself, my soul, the body that has brought me this far. With every new combination, it's like I'm reborn.
            Because I'm not a simple girl. I'm a girl with big dreams, a heart full of love, and a style I created myself, for myself, with all my feelings</P><BR><BR>
